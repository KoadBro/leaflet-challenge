# leaflet-challenge

My first step was to visualize an earthquake dataset. I proceeded to visit the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site. page and chose the "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" a dataset to visualize.

Once I chose a dataset, I was given a JSON representation of that data and used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization. I imported and visualized the data using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
